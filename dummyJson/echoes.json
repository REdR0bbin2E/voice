She wore soft cardigans, hummed lullabies while making breakfast, and had a gentle laugh that put children at ease. The touch of her hand, the creak of her favorite chair, and her habit of writing sticky notes are what I remember most. Once, she gave away an entire pie to a neighbor who had a hard day, showing her generosity.",
