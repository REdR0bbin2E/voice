## 🧪 How to Test

### Option 1: Test Backend Voice Cloning (Web Interface)

1. **Open browser to:** http://localhost:5000
2. **Upload audio file:**
   - Click "Choose File"
   - Select: `backend/inputs/Countdown & Encouragement 18.mp3`
   - Click "Upload & Create Voice Model"
   - Wait 10-30 seconds
   - Get Model ID ✅

3. **Generate Voice:**
   - Type some text (e.g., "Hello, this is a test!")
   - Model ID should be auto-filled
   - Click "🎙️ Generate Voice"
   - Wait 10-30 seconds
   - Audio file saved to `backend/outputs/voice_XXX.mp3` ✅

---

### Option 2: Test Backend via Script

**Quick Test:**
```powershell
cd backend
python test_inputs_folder.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✅ Upload successful!
   Model ID: [your-model-id]
✅ Voice generation successful!
   File: backend/outputs/voice_XXX.mp3
```

---

### Option 3: Test Frontend Mobile App

1. **Expo is running** - Check terminal for QR code
2. **Install Expo Go** on your phone (iOS/Android)
3. **Scan QR code** shown in terminal
4. **App should load** on your device
5. **Test navigation:**
   - Login screen → Tabs (Home, Echoes, Timeline, Share)
   - Try creating an Echo
   - Test chat functionality

---

### Option 4: Test Frontend on Web

1. **In the Expo terminal, press `w`**
2. **Browser opens to:** http://localhost:8081
3. **You should see:** Login screen
4. **Test flow:**
   - Login → Homepage
   - Navigate between tabs
   - Test all features

---

## 🔌 Testing Backend + Frontend Integration

### Check if Frontend Can Call Backend:

1. **Backend must be running:** http://localhost:5000 ✅
2. **Frontend must be running:** http://localhost:8081 ✅
3. **Test API connection from frontend**

**If you get CORS errors:**
- Backend already has `CORS(app)` enabled in `api_server.py`
- Should work across localhost ports

---

## 📊 System Health Check

### Backend Health:
```bash
# In browser or curl:
http://localhost:5000/health
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "fish_audio_api": "connected",
  "mongodb": "not configured"
}
```

### Frontend Health:
- Server running on port 8081 ✅
- QR code displayed ✅
- No bundler errors ✅

---

## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

### Start Backend Only:
```powershell
python backend/api_server.py
```

### Start Frontend Only:
```powershell
npm start
# Then press 'w' for web or scan QR for mobile
```

### Start Both (Two Terminals):
**Terminal 1 (Backend):**
```powershell
python backend/api_server.py
```

**Terminal 2 (Frontend):**
```powershell
npm start
```

---

## 🎊 Success Indicators

**Backend is working when you see:**
```
✅ All services initialized successfully
🚀 Starting Echo Backend API Server
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

**Frontend is working when you see:**
```
› Metro waiting on exp://10.234.127.239:8081
› Web is waiting on http://localhost:8081
```

**Both are integrated when:**
- Frontend can call `http://localhost:5000/api/...`
- No CORS errors
- Data flows between frontend and backend

## 💡 Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Backend First:**
   - Go to http://localhost:5000
   - Try voice cloning with the web interface
   - Verify files save to `backend/outputs/`

2. **Then Test Frontend:**
   - Press `w` in Expo terminal
   - Navigate through the app
   - Test all screens

3. **Then Test Integration:**
   - Make API calls from frontend to backend
   - Verify data flow works

**Both systems are ready for testing!** 🎊
